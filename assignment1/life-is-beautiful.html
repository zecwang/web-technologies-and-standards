            <h2>Brief introduction</h2>
            <p><strong><em>Life Is Beautiful</em></strong> (Italian: La vita è bella, Italian pronunciation: [la
                ˈviːta ˌɛ bˈbɛlla]) is a 1997 Italian
                comedy-drama film directed by and starring Roberto Benigni, who co-wrote the film with Vincenzo
                Cerami.
                Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a Jewish Italian bookshop owner, who employs his fertile imagination to
                shield
                his son from the horrors of internment in a Nazi concentration camp. The film was partially inspired
                by
                the
                book In the End, I Beat Hitler by Rubino Romeo Salmonì and by Benigni's father, who spent two years
                in a
                German labour camp during World War II.</p>

            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>In 1939, in the Kingdom of Italy, Guido Orefice is a young Jewish man who arrives to work in the city
                (Arezzo, in Tuscany) where his uncle Eliseo operates a restaurant. Guido is comical and sharp, and
                falls
                in
                love with a girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to
                be
                engaged to a rich, but arrogant, man, a local government official with whom Guido has regular
                run-ins.
                Guido
                sets up many "coincidental" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Finally, Dora sees Guido's
                affection
                and
                promise, and gives in, against her better judgement. He steals her from her engagement party, on a
                horse,
                humiliating her fiancé and mother. They are later married and have a son, Giosué (Joshua), and run a
                bookstore.
            </p>
            <p>When World War II breaks out, Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosué are seized on Giosué's birthday.
                They
                and
                many other Jews are forced onto a train and taken to a concentration camp. After confronting a guard
                about
                her husband and son, and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in
                order to
                be
                close to her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido never see
                each
                other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp's loudspeaker to
                send
                messages—symbolic or literal—to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is
                executed in
                a
                gas chamber shortly after their arrival. Giosuè narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to
                take
                baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas
                chambers and were told they were showers.</p>
            <p>
                In the camp, Guido hides their true situation from his son. Guido explains to Giosué that the camp
                is a
                complicated game in which he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Each of the tasks will earn
                them
                points
                and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries,
                complains
                that
                he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from
                the
                camp
                guards earn extra points. Giosué is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido
                convinces
                him
                each time to continue. At one point Guido takes advantage of the appearance of visiting German
                officers
                and
                their families to show Giosuè that other children are hiding as part of the game, and he also takes
                advantage of a German nanny thinking Giosué is one of her charges in order to feed him as Guido
                serves
                the
                German officers. Guido and Giosué are almost found out to be prisoners by another server until Guido
                is
                found teaching all of the German children how to say "Thank you" in Italian.
            </p>
            <p>
                Guido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the
                Allied
                forces approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final
                task
                in
                the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but he is caught by a
                German
                soldier. An officer makes the decision to execute Guido, who is led off by the soldier. While he is
                walking
                to his death, Guido passes by Giosué one last time and winks, still in character and playing the
                game.
                Guido
                is then shot and left for dead in an alleyway. The next morning, Giosué emerges from the sweat-box,
                just
                as
                a US Army unit led by a Sherman tank arrives and the camp is liberated. Giosuè is overjoyed about
                winning
                the game (unaware that his father is dead), thinking that he won the tank, and an American soldier
                allows
                Giosuè to ride on the tank. While travelling to safety, Giosué soon spots Dora in the procession
                leaving
                the
                camp and reunites with his mother. While the young Giosué excitedly tells his mother about how he
                had
                won a
                tank, just as his father had promised, the adult Giosué, in an overheard monologue, reminisces on
                the
                sacrifices his father made for him and his story.
