            <h2>Brief introduction</h2>
            <p><strong><em>The Godfather</em></strong> is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford
                Coppola
                and
                produced by Albert S. Ruddy,
                based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as
                the
                leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the
                family
                under
                the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino)
                from
                reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.</p>
            <p>The film was the highest-grossing film of 1972, and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever
                made,
                with
                a gross of around $245–286 million at the box office. The film received universal acclaim from
                critics
                and
                audiences, with praise going towards the performances of its cast, particularly from Brando and
                Pacino,
                the
                directing, screenplay, cinematography, editing, score, and portrayal of the mafia. The film
                revitalized
                Brando's career, which was in decline during the 1960s before going on to star in hits such as Last
                Tango in
                Paris, Superman, and Apocalypse Now, and launched the successful careers of Coppola, Pacino, and the
                rest of
                the cast. At the 45th Academy Awards, it won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and
                Best
                Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). Its seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, James
                Caan,
                Robert Duvall (Best Supporting Actor), and Coppola for Best Director.</p>
            <p>Since its release, The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films
                ever
                made, especially in the gangster genre. It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film
                Registry
                of the Library of Congress in 1990, being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically
                significant"
                and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film
                Institute. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and The Godfather Part III
                (1990).</p>
