            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p style="text-transform: uppercase">In 1280, King Edward "Longshanks" invades and conquers Scotland
                following
                the death of Alexander III of Scotland, who left no heir to the throne. Young William Wallace
                witnesses
                Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father and brother, and is taken abroad on a
                pilgrimage
                throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle, where he is educated. Years later, in 1297,
                Longshanks
                grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including Prima Nocte. Meanwhile, a grown
                Wallace
                returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough, and the two
                marry
                in
                secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their
                second
                attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to
                slaughter
                the
                English garrison in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England.</p>
            <p style="text-transform: uppercase">Longshanks orders his son Prince Edward to stop Wallace by any
                means
                necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the
                surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at the Battle of Stirling and then
                destroys
                the city of York, killing Longshanks' nephew and sending his severed head to the king. Wallace seeks
                the
                assistance of Robert the Bruce, the son of nobleman Robert the Elder and a contender for the
                Scottish
                crown.
                Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the
                English.
                Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife Isabella of France to try to
                negotiate with Wallace as a distraction for the landing of another invasion force in Scotland.</p>
            <p style="text-transform: uppercase">After meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace.
                She
                warns him of the coming invasion, and Wallace implores the Scottish nobility to take immediate
                action to
                counter the threat and take back the country, asking Robert the Bruce to lead. In 1298, leading the
                English
                army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at Falkirk. There, noblemen Mornay and Lochlan turn
                their
                backs
                on Wallace after being bribed by the king. Wallace is then further betrayed when he discovers Robert
                the
                Bruce was fighting alongside Longshanks; after the battle, after seeing the damage he helped do to
                his
                countrymen, the Bruce vows not to be on the wrong side again.</p>
            <p style="text-transform: uppercase">Wallace kills Lochlan and Mornay for their betrayal, and wages a
                guerrilla
                war against the English for the next seven years, assisted by Isabella, with whom he eventually has
                an
                affair. In 1305, Robert sets up a meeting with Wallace in Edinburgh, but Robert's father has
                conspired
                with
                other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert
                disowns
                and
                banishes his father. Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by telling him
                that
                his
                bloodline will be destroyed upon his death as she is now pregnant with Wallace's child.</p>
            <p style="text-transform: uppercase">In London, Wallace is brought before an English magistrate, tried
                for
                high
                treason, and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being hanged, drawn and
                quartered,
                Wallace refuses to submit to the king. As cries for mercy come from the watching crowd deeply moved
                by
                the
                Scotsman's valor, the magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word,
                "Mercy",
                and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, "Freedom!", and the judge orders his death. As
                Wallace's cry rings through the square, Longshanks hears it just before dying. Moments before being
                decapitated, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, smiling at him.</p>
            <p style="text-transform: uppercase">In 1314, Robert, now Scotland's king, leads a Scottish army before
                a
                ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of Bannockburn, where he is to formally accept
                English
                rule.
                As he begins to ride toward the English, he stops and invokes Wallace's memory. Hamish throws
                Wallace's
                sword, Braveheart, point-down in front of the English army, imploring his men to fight with Robert
                as
                they
                did with Wallace. With the Scots chanting Wallace's name, Robert then leads his army into battle
                against
                the
                stunned English, winning the Scots their freedom. The final shot of the film is the sun setting
                behind
                Braveheart as it sways in the wind.</p>
