                    <h2>Brief introduction</h2>
                    <p><strong><em>The Godfather</em></strong> is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford
                        Coppola
                        and
                        produced by Albert S. Ruddy,
                        based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino
                        as
                        the
                        leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the
                        family
                        under
                        the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone
                        (Pacino)
                        from
                        reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.</p>
                    <p>The film was the highest-grossing film of 1972, and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever
                        made,
                        with
                        a gross of around $245–286 million at the box office. The film received universal acclaim from
                        critics
                        and
                        audiences, with praise going towards the performances of its cast, particularly from Brando and
                        Pacino,
                        the
                        directing, screenplay, cinematography, editing, score, and portrayal of the mafia. The film
                        revitalized
                        Brando's career, which was in decline during the 1960s before going on to star in hits such as
                        Last
                        Tango in
                        Paris, Superman, and Apocalypse Now, and launched the successful careers of Coppola, Pacino, and
                        the
                        rest of
                        the cast. At the 45th Academy Awards, it won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando)
                        and
                        Best
                        Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). Its seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino,
                        James
                        Caan,
                        Robert Duvall (Best Supporting Actor), and Coppola for Best Director.</p>
                    <p>Since its release, The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential
                        films
                        ever
                        made, especially in the gangster genre. It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National
                        Film
                        Registry
                        of the Library of Congress in 1990, being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically
                        significant"
                        and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American
                        Film
                        Institute. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and The Godfather Part III
                        (1990).</p>
